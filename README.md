# Avalanche-Advanced-Subnet

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a ```custom blockchain``` and ```virtual machine (VM)``` using the ```Avalanche HyperSDK```. The ```HyperSDK``` enables developers to have full control over the rules, features, and functionality of their ```blockchain```. This project focuses on building a blockchain that allows users to ```mint```, ```transfer``` tokens, and optionally manage an order book for asset trading.

The ```HyperSDK is currently in its ```alpha``` phase, so the features and functionality may change in the future. This project uses an example ```token VM``` that has been tested and is guaranteed to be maintained in the upcoming releases.

## Description

### Key Features
#### ➛ ```Custom Virtual Machine```:
 Define a custom VM with fully controllable blockchain logic.  
  
#### ➛ ```Token Minting```:
Create and distribute custom tokens.  
  
#### ➛ ```Token Transfers  ```:
Allow users to transfer tokens securely between accounts..      
  
#### ➛ ```Checking Token Balance```:
Players can check their token balance at any time to keep track of their items and resources.    
  
#### ➛ ```Order Book (Optional)```:
Implement a traditional order book for trading assets.

#### ➛ ```Custom Blockchain Deployment```:
Tailor the blockchain to meet your specific startup needs, such as specific tokenomics or user behavior.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, make sure you have the following tools installed:
➛ [@Go(Golang)](https://go.dev/doc/install) - Version 1.18 or higher
➛ [@Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Project Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hyper-sdk-custom-subnet.git
cd hyper-sdk-custom-subnet
```
#### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure that the project dependencies are properly installed and up-to-date using the Go Modules system.
```
go mod tidy
```
This command normalizes all dependencies and installs the required packages based on the go.mod file.
#### Deployment on Remix IDE
1. Open the ```remix ide``` in your web browser.
2. Create a new file in ```Remix IDE```.
3. Compile the contract by selecting the appropriate Solidity compiler version in Remix IDE and clicking the "Compile" button.
4. Connect ```MetaMask``` to Remix IDE by clicking on the MetaMask extension icon in your browser and following the instructions to log in.
5. Deploy the contract by clicking the ```"Deploy & Run Transactions"``` tab in Remix IDE.
6. Click the ```"Deploy"``` button to deploy the contract to the selected testnet.
7. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask and wait for the contract to be deployed. Once deployed, you will see the contract address in the ```Remix IDE```.

#### Connection
1. Go to ```Snowtrace``` website.

2. Copy the contract address from ```Remix IDE``` and paste into the search bar on the ```Snowtrace```.

3. You can now get the informations about the functions.
